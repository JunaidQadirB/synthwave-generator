# Synthwave Name Generator

## How it works

All the magic happens in `app/NameGenerator.php`. Additional nouns can be added to the `$nouns` array. You can add some modifiers to a noun to ensure it's first, last, doesn't end up next to existing names (like "Arcade High", for example), has a specific separator, and so on.

**Explanation of all the possible modifiers on a noun:**

``` php
$nouns = [
    [
        'word' => 'Streets of', // The noun
        'prefix' => true, // True to ensure it's the first word in the name
        'suffix' => false, // True to ensure it's the last word in the name
        'not' => 'Rage', // Add other nouns you want to ensure is *not* next to. Can be an array or string.
        'plural' => false, // False to prevent the word from being pluralized
        'seperator' => ' ', // Force a specific seperator between words
    ],
]
```

**The name is generated by a series of dice rolls:**

1. There is always at least one noun, but if the roll succeeds there may be a second word.
2. If there are two words, they may be mashed together as a portmanteau or separated with a space or string provided by the first noun.
3. The whole word might be pluralized.
4. And finally there may be a year slapped on the end.
